# Interactive-Learning-Using-Mobile-based-Augmented-Reality-Application

A method of teaching that has brought significant contributions to the field of education is augmented reality. 
This technology will make learning more enjoyable and interesting. 
The augmented reality application in this project supports the learning of geometric figures, solar system, wild animals, auto-mobiles, etc. 
The AR-Book and AR-App consists of target images and software that can read special markers. 
After installing the app in mobile device, when this book is placed in front of the camera of a mobile device, 3D objects, animations, and other interactive elements leap from book pages making learning more fun and exciting. 

Utilized Unity 3D and Visual Studio Code to create a user-friendly Android application that integrated AR functionality seamlessly.
Implemented marker-based AR using Vuforia, allowing users to scan physical markers with the application to trigger 3D animated figures related to the educational content.
Wrote C# scripts to animate and control the behavior of 3D figures, enhancing the interactive and immersive learning experience.
Utilized Java for Android application development, ensuring smooth functionality and performance on mobile devices.
